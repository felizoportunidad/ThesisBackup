\chapter{Summary and Future Research} \label{cha:chap5}

In this dissertation, we have focused on some of the elements of next-generation treatment planning system. Specifically, Chapter \ref{chap1} provided the background of treatment planning and some of the current limitations. Chapter \ref{chap2} described the monte carlo simulation using cloud computing, which provide a remedy for the high speed dose calculation problem. An autopilot scheme of VMAT/IMRT planning with the guidance of prior knowledge was discussed in Chapter \ref{chap3}. Chapter \ref{chap4} investigates an autopilot scheme of VMAT/IMRT planning with the guidance of population-based prior knowledge.  The proposed autopiloting approach were evaluated in a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) platform. 

There is still room for improvement in the subjects studied here. In Chapter \ref{chap2}, on-going research topic along the line of cloud computing  .... In Chapter \ref{chap3}, improvement is still needed to achieve a better ... Specifically, the current decision making is simple for the ease of incorporating prior information. More sophisticated decision making should be further tested for superior results. In Chapter \ref{chap4}, ..... maybe use referee comments here ........
